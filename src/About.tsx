      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        When we moved to Sherwood, we struggled with sports activities for our
        kids. Knowing what was available and when you needed to sign up was and
        is chore. Information is spread across dozens of websites--all
        different--making it tough to just find some activities for you or your
        kids. More often that not we'd learn what was coming up via
        word-of-mouth, or being in a certain Facebook group. But we can do
        better!
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this site is to surface practical information about sports
        organizations for folks in the Sherwood area. My hope is that if it
        gains traction, and the power of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">
          {" "}
          crowdsourcing{" "}
        </a>
        can be harnessed, together we'll build a comprehensive, up-to-date
        resource for the community.

      <h3>What's included</h3>
      <p>
        The site track sports programs based Sherwood. There are are some nearby
        (think Tualatin, not Portland) groups include if they fill a gap. For
        example, Tualatin's MVP sports offers flag football through 8th grade,
        whereas Sherwood's club stops at 4th.
